# MCP server — agentic editing

UberEditor embeds an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server so an agent
(Claude Code, or anything that speaks MCP) can drive the editor: import
footage, transcribe it, cut it, animate it, subtitle it and render it — without
touching the GUI.

The design goal is **parity**: every feature a human can reach through the UI is
reachable through a tool, over the same code path. A change that adds a UI
feature and no tool is a bug (`tests/mcp_tests.rs::tools_cover_the_whole_editor_and_are_documented`
fails on purpose).

---

## Connecting

The server starts with the app on `http://127.0.0.1:4599/mcp`. It is
**loopback-only** and **requires a Bearer token**, regenerated on each startup
and shown in the **MCP** pill in the app header (click it to copy the command):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http ubereditor http://127.0.0.1:4599/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

Anything else gets `401` with a JSON-RPC error. Transport is JSON-RPC 2.0 over
HTTP POST (`initialize`, `ping`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`); notifications get
`202` and no body.

Quick check without an agent:

```bash
TOKEN=$(cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/net.pequesoft.ubereditor/mcp_token)   # macOS
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4599/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call",
       "params":{"name":"get_project_summary","arguments":{}}}' | jq -r '.result.content[0].text' | jq
```

## The rules

1. **Time is always integer microseconds (µs) on the timeline.** Never seconds,
   never frames. `1 s = 1_000_000`. A float is rejected at the boundary.
2. **One tool call = one undo entry.** `set_clip_properties` can change the
   transform, the audio, the effects and the speed at once; a single `undo`
   reverts all of it. The user can undo an agent's work from the UI.
3. **A failed call changes nothing.** Every mutation goes through
   `ProjectStore::dispatch`, which validates the project invariants and rolls
   back atomically. There is no half-applied state.
4. **Errors are tool errors, not protocol errors** — `isError: true` and a
   message meant to be acted on ("the audio is still being prepared…").
5. **Ids are ULID strings.** Get them from `get_timeline`, `get_media_pool` or
   `get_project_summary`. Never invent one. Clips also carry a friendly
   `label` in `get_timeline`, and you can set one with `set_clip_name`.
6. **Slow tools are async.** `transcribe_asset`, `export_video` and
   `generate_avatar_video` hand back a `job_id`; poll `get_job_status`. A
   client timeout on the launch is not a failure — the job runs on.

---

## Typical session

```jsonc
get_project_summary {}                            // what is open? which sequence is active?
import_media { "paths": ["/abs/take1.mp4"] }      // → asset_id
transcribe_asset { "asset_id": "…" }              // → job_id; poll get_job_status → {transcript_id}
add_clip { "asset_id": "…" }                      // → clip_id
remove_silences { "clip_id": "…", "mode": "delete" }
add_subtitles_clip { "clip_id": "…" }
debug_render_frame { "t_us": 1000000 }            // SEE the frame (subtitles included) before exporting
export_video { "path": "/abs/out.mp4" }           // → job_id; poll get_job_status → {path}
save_project { "path": "/abs/project.uep" }
```

**Timing gotcha.** `import_media` returns immediately, but the audio *conform*
(the WAV the analysis tools read) is built in the background. Until it lands,
`transcribe_asset`, `remove_silences` and `generate_avatar_video` fail with
_"the audio is still being prepared (conform); try again in a few seconds"_.
Poll `get_media_pool` and wait for `audio_conform` to be non-null.

**Slow tools are async — a timeout is NOT a failure.** `transcribe_asset`,
`generate_avatar_video` and `export_video` return a `job_id` immediately and
run in the background (minutes; the first transcription also downloads the
Whisper model). Poll `get_job_status {job_id}` until `status` is `done` (the
real result is in `result`) or `error`. **Never re-run one because the launch
"timed out"** — the job is still going; re-transcribing replaces the
transcript, re-exporting wastes minutes. While a job runs on its thread, the
server still answers other calls (polls, reads).

## Tools

51 tools. `tools/list` carries the full schema for each, plus MCP annotations:

| annotation | meaning |
|---|---|
| `readOnlyHint` | reads state, changes nothing — always safe to call |
| `destructiveHint` | **cannot** be reverted with `undo` (writes a file, replaces the project, adds an asset) |
| neither | mutates the project; one `undo` reverts it |

### Reading state

| Tool | What you get |
|---|---|
| `get_project_summary` | name, save path, every sequence (id, resolution, fps, duration, tracks), asset/transcript counts, avatar setups, undo history |
| `get_timeline` | the full sequence: tracks → clips, each with a human-friendly `label`, payload, transform, audio, effects, transition |
| `get_media_pool` | assets: id, path, kind, duration, probe, and whether `audio_conform`/`proxy`/`transcript` are ready |
| `get_transcript` | the transcript at a chosen `granularity`, optionally windowed (see below) |
| `find_words` | locate a word/phrase → each hit's timestamp + neighbour context |
| `get_catalog` | effect ids + their params, generator ids, installed font families, saved text templates, avatar setups, subtitle modes, transition ids |

**`get_transcript` granularity.** The full word dump is 100k+ characters, so
this tool is tiered. Default `phrases` (caption-sized chunks with timestamps)
is the right unit for choosing cuts. `start_us`/`end_us` window any level.

| `granularity` | returns |
|---|---|
| `text` | just the words joined, no timing (cheap, for reading) |
| `segments` | Whisper's own coarse chunks (carry emotion/volume) |
| `phrases` (default) / `sentences` | caption-sized chunks `{text, start_us, end_us}` |
| `words` | every word `{index, text, start_us, end_us}` — window it |

**`find_words`** `{query, asset_id|transcript_id, context?}` → `{hits: [{index,
start_us, end_us, context}]}`. Case- and punctuation-insensitive; multi-word
phrases work. This is how you find a cut point: `find_words "in conclusion"` →
its `start_us`, then `cut_ranges`/`move_range` around it.

### Media

- **`import_media`** `{paths[]}` → asset ids. Idempotent by content hash. Does
  not place anything on the timeline.
- **`transcribe_asset`** `{asset_id, model?}` → **`job_id`** (async; poll
  `get_job_status` → `{transcript_id, words}`). Word-level Whisper. Required by
  `add_subtitles_clip`, `replace_words`, `set_word_text` and
  `generate_avatar_video`. Re-transcribing **keeps the transcript id**, so
  existing subtitles clips keep working — you don't need to recreate them.
- **`set_project_settings`** `{whisper_language?, whisper_model?}` — the
  defaults `transcribe_asset` uses. Set the language (`es`, `en`, `auto`)
  *before* transcribing.
- **`relink_asset`** `{asset_id, new_path}` — repairs media flagged `offline`
  after a project's footage moved.

### Timeline structure

`add_clip`, `add_text_clip`, `add_generator_clip`, `add_subtitles_clip`,
`split_clip`, `delete_clips`, `move_clip`, `trim_clip`, `unlink_clip`,
`cut_ranges`, `move_range`.

`cut_ranges` and `move_range` operate on **all tracks at once** and are the
right tools for text-based editing: read the word timestamps from
`get_transcript`, then cut or reorder those ranges.

### Clip properties

**`set_clip_properties`** is the workhorse. `transform` and `audio` are
**partial patches** (only the keys you send change); `effects` **replaces** the
chain. Everything numeric also accepts a keyframe curve.

```jsonc
set_clip_properties {
  "clip_id": "01J…",
  "transform": {
    "position_x": 120,                       // px from the canvas centre
    "opacity": { "keys": [                   // …or an animated curve
      { "t": 0,       "value": 0, "interp": { "kind": "linear" } },
      { "t": 1000000, "value": 1, "interp": { "kind": "linear" } }
    ]}
  },
  "audio": { "gain_db": -6, "denoise": true },
  "effects": [{ "effect_id": "core.blur", "params": { "sigma": 8 } }],
  "transition_in": { "duration_us": 500000 },  // null removes it
  "speed": 1.5                                  // pitch preserved
}
```

Curve keys are `{t, value, interp}` where `t` is **µs from the start of the
clip** (not the timeline) and `interp.kind` is `linear`, `hold` or `smooth`.
Keys are sorted and de-duplicated on write.

Transform patch keys: `position_x/y`, `scale_x/y`, `rotation` (degrees),
`opacity` (0..1), `crop_left/top/right/bottom` (0..1), `flip_h`, `flip_v`.
`position` is in **pixels from the canvas centre**; `y_offset` (in `style`) is
in **pixels from the bottom** — positive moves the caption up.

**`set_clip_content`** edits what a clip *shows*, depending on its payload: the
words and style of a Text clip, the style and `subtitles_mode` of a Subtitles
clip, or the parameters of a Generator clip. `style` is a patch too, and it
**warns** (doesn't fail) if the `font` isn't installed — a font that doesn't
resolve draws nothing. The default `sans-serif` (and `serif`/`monospace`) map
to a real installed font, so they always render.

**`set_clip_name`** `{clip_id, name}` gives a clip a readable name (empty
clears it). `get_timeline` shows a `label` for every clip — the custom name, or
one derived from the payload (media filename, title text, generator id) — so
you never work from raw ULIDs.

Subtitle modes (what each actually produces):

| `subtitles_mode` | on screen |
|---|---|
| `phrase` (default) | caption-sized chunks built from the **word** timestamps — short, ~a line; NOT Whisper's minute-long segments. Great for shorts. |
| `word` | one large word at a time (TikTok style) |
| `karaoke` | the phrase line with the current word highlighted as it's spoken (per-word fill is export-only; the preview shows the phrase) |

`phrase` chunk size follows the font size and canvas width. For fewer/longer
lines, raise the subtitle `size` less or widen the canvas; the same chunker is
exposed as `get_transcript { granularity: "phrases", max_chars }` if you want
to preview the split.

### Tracks and sequences

`add_track`, `remove_track`, `set_track_prop` (exactly one of `name`, `muted`,
`solo`, `locked`, `volume_db` per call); `set_sequence_props` (resolution/fps),
`set_active_sequence`, `remove_sequence`, `generate_vertical`.

### AI

- **`remove_silences`** `{clip_id, mode: delete|speedup|split, threshold_db?, min_silence_ms?, pad_ms?}`
  — `delete` cuts and closes the gaps, `speedup` runs them at 4×, `split` only
  cuts at the edges. All tracks, one undo.
- **`replace_words`** `{transcript_id, from, to}` — fixes a recurring
  mis-transcription everywhere (`godo` → `Godot`). Audio untouched; captions
  show the correction.
- **`set_word_text`** `{transcript_id, index, text}` — one word by index.
- **`save_avatar_config`** `{config}` → `config_id`; `remove_avatar_config`,
  `import_avatar_config` (ours or a Youtubers-toolkit `config.json`; same name
  replaces instead of duplicating) and `export_avatar_config` (**never** writes
  the `api_key` out).
- **`generate_avatar_video`** `{config_id, driver_asset}` → **`job_id`** (async;
  poll `get_job_status` → `{asset_id}`). A transparent avatar video, imported as
  an asset. **The driver is the voice**: only the asset's transcript and audio
  matter, never its video.

### Jobs (async long operations)

`transcribe_asset`, `export_video` and `generate_avatar_video` return a
`job_id` right away and run in the background.

- **`get_job_status`** `{job_id}` → `{status: running|done|error, progress,
  message, result?, error?}`. Poll until `done` (result is in `result`) or
  `error`. A launch that "times out" client-side is **still running** — poll,
  don't re-run.
- **`list_jobs`** — every job this session, newest first.

### Project, render, history

- `new_project`, `open_project`, `save_project` — the first two **discard the
  open project and its history**.
- `reload_effect_packs` — re-read the user effect packs after writing a
  manifest to disk, so an agent can extend the editor and use the new effect
  in the same session.
- **`export_video`** `{path, ranges?, format?, max_height?, crf?, loudnorm?}` →
  **`job_id`** (async; poll `get_job_status` → `{path, pieces}`). `ranges:
  [[start_us, end_us], …]` renders several chunks of the timeline concatenated
  **into one file**, in the order given (the "pieces" feature). Omit it to
  render everything. The timeline is snapshotted at call time.
- `undo`, `redo`.

### Debugging what the user sees

The paused preview, the playback stream and the export are **three different
code paths**. `debug_render_frame` and `debug_playback_frame` **return the JPEG
as an image** you can see (plus the temp path), and error with a clear message
instead of handing back a black frame.

| Tool | Path |
|---|---|
| `debug_render_frame {t_us}` | the **paused** preview — includes titles + subtitles active at `t_us`, composited like the export |
| `debug_playback_frame {}` | whatever is in the **playback** stream buffer right now |
| `playback {action: play\|pause\|seek\|position}` | drives the real player |
| `export_video` | the export |

**The paused preview matches the export frame for frame.** `debug_render_frame`
composites every active video layer (base + overlays), each clip's transform
and effects, and the titles/subtitles — the same way the export burns them in,
verified pixel-for-pixel (`preview_matches_export_pixel_for_pixel`). So it's a
faithful way to check a composition without a full render.

A **generated avatar is just normal media**: `generate_avatar_video` renders a
`.mov` and imports it into the pool, so once it's on the timeline it's an
ordinary video clip — composited 1:1 like any other. (The legacy live-reactive
`Avatar` clip type is deprecated and not shown in the preview; use the
generate-then-place flow.) The one remaining exception is **karaoke**, which
shows the phrase line without the per-word highlight in preview.

## What is deliberately *not* a tool

The coverage test allows exactly these gaps, so the list stays honest:

| Command | Why not |
|---|---|
| `get_state`, `ui_log`, `mcp_status` | GUI plumbing; `get_project_summary` + `get_timeline` cover the state |
| `get_audio_peaks`, `ensure_thumbs`, `get_thumb_strip`, `playback_frame` | visual caches and binary streams for the timeline widget |
| `pick_avatar_media` | opens a native file dialog; an agent passes paths directly |
| `cancel_export` | the agent controls export timing through the job (it just doesn't launch one it doesn't want) |
| `add_avatar_clip` | legacy toolkit path, superseded by `save_avatar_config` → `generate_avatar_video` → `add_clip` |
| `check_recovery`, `recover_project`, `discard_recovery` | the UI's crash-recovery prompt; they need the app's data dir |
| `set_clip_transform/audio/effects/speed/transition`, `set_clip_text`, `set_subtitles_props`, `set_clip_generator` | folded into `set_clip_properties` / `set_clip_content` (one call, one undo) |
| `rename_track`, `set_track_volume` | folded into `set_track_prop` |
| `get_effects_catalog`, `get_generators`, `list_fonts`, `list_avatar_configs`, `list_text_templates` | folded into `get_catalog` |
| `playback_play/pause/seek/position`, `render_frame` | folded into `playback` / `debug_render_frame` |

Everything else registered in `invoke_handler` has a tool.

## Extending

Tools live in `src-tauri/src/mcp.rs`:

- `tool_defs()` — the schema an agent reads. Every argument needs a
  `description`; `additionalProperties: false` makes typos fail loudly.
- `call_tool()` — the dispatch. Handlers reuse the UI's implementation
  (`crate::*_impl` in `lib.rs`) so the agent and the human hit the same code.
  Never re-implement an operation here.
- `handle_rpc()` is pure over `AppState`, so tests drive it without HTTP.

Adding a tool means: a `tool(...)` entry, a `call_tool` arm, and a name in the
coverage test. If the operation needs logic the UI already has, extract it into
a `pub(crate) fn …_impl(state: &AppState, …)` and let the `#[tauri::command]`
call it too.
