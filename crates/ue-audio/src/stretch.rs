//! WSOLA time-stretcher: plays a source at a different speed WITHOUT changing
//! the pitch (the live counterpart of the export's `atempo`).
//!
//! Classic waveform-similarity overlap-add: Hann windows at 50% overlap laid
//! down at the output rate while the source read position advances at
//! `speed ×` rate; each window is nudged (±SEARCH frames) to the offset that
//! best continues the previous one, which removes the phasing/garbling of a
//! naive overlap-add. Good speech quality for the 0.25×–4× range we expose.
//!
//! The stretcher is sequential by design; the mixer feeds it monotonically
//! increasing output positions and it resets itself on any jump (seek).
