//! Embedded MCP server: the full agentic surface of the editor.
//!
//! Direct implementation of the MCP protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 over streamable
//! HTTP, `application/json` response) on 127.0.0.1:4599/mcp, no SDK:
//! `initialize`, `tools/list` and `tools/call`. Loopback only, Bearer token.
//! The dispatcher (`handle_rpc`) is a pure function over `AppState` →
//! testable without HTTP (see `tests/mcp_tests.rs`).

//! # Design rules for the tools
//!
//! 1. **One tool call = one undo entry.** Tools that change several things
//!    (`set_clip_properties`) batch their actions into a single `dispatch`, so
//!    a single `undo` reverts the whole call. Never `dispatch` twice.
//! 2. **Every mutation goes through `ProjectStore::dispatch`**, which validates
//!    the project invariants and rolls back atomically on failure. A tool can
//!    therefore never leave the project in a broken state.
//! 3. **Times are always µs (i64) on the timeline**, never seconds or frames.
//! 4. **Errors are tool errors, not protocol errors**: `isError: true` with a
//!    human-readable message the agent can act on.
//! 5. **The MCP path reuses the UI's implementation** (`crate::*_impl`) so an
//!    agent and a human hit the exact same code — the preview/export parity
//!    rule applies to agents too.

UberEditor — a video editor you can drive end to end.

MODEL
  Project → sequences → tracks (video/audio) → clips. A clip's payload is
  Media | Text | Subtitles | Generator | Avatar. Transcripts live on the
  project and are referenced by asset id.

UNITS
  Every time is an INTEGER of MICROSECONDS (µs) on the TIMELINE, never
  seconds and never frames. 1 s = 1_000_000. Fractional values are rejected.
  Ids are ULID strings; get them from get_timeline / get_media_pool.

HISTORY
  Every mutating tool is one undo entry: `undo` reverts exactly one tool call.
  A call that would break a project invariant fails and changes nothing.

TYPICAL FLOW
  1. get_project_summary            — what is open, what is in it
  2. get_media_pool / get_timeline  — ids to work with
  3. import_media                   — bring files in (conform runs in background)
  4. transcribe_asset               — needed by subtitles, silences, avatar
  5. edit: split_clip, delete_clips, move_clip, trim_clip, cut_ranges,
     set_clip_properties, add_text_clip, add_subtitles_clip, remove_silences
  6. export_video                   — one file, optionally several `ranges`
  7. save_project

GOTCHAS
  • After import_media the audio conform runs in the BACKGROUND. Tools that
    need audio (transcribe_asset, remove_silences, generate_avatar_video) fail
    with 'audio is still being prepared' until it lands. Retry after a moment.
  • transcribe_asset and generate_avatar_video BLOCK for minutes and download
    models on first use.
  • remove_silences/cut_ranges/move_range act on ALL tracks at once.
  • The preview and the export share the same ffmpeg chain: what you render
    with debug_render_frame is what export_video writes.";
