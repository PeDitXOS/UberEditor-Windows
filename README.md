# UberEditor
*[Español](README.es.md)*

Cross-platform desktop video editor (Tauri 2 + Rust + React) built for content creators, with AI superpowers: **text-based editing** (word-by-word Whisper), **silences gone with one click**, **automatic verticals**, **emotion-reactive avatar**, **karaoke subtitles**, and an **embedded MCP server** so an agent (Claude, etc.) can edit your project for you.

**The master plan lives in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md)** — architecture, all 16 features in detail, the Youtubers-toolkit mapping, and the roadmap.

- UI is 100% in English · warm charcoal theme with an amber accent
- Everything is undoable: every operation (including the AI and MCP ones) is **one** undo entry
- Same render engine in preview and export (shared ffmpeg chains): what you see is what you get
- 105 tests (unit, pixel tests over real exports, and 13 visual steps with Playwright)

## Requirements

| What | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **FFmpeg + FFprobe** | ≥ 6 on the `PATH` | The heart of the render. `brew install ffmpeg` / `apt install ffmpeg`. You can point to specific binaries with `UE_FFMPEG` and `UE_FFPROBE` |
| **Rust** | stable | Only for building |
| **Node** | ≥ 20 | Only for building / development |

```bash
npm install
npx tauri dev        # the full desktop app
```

Nothing else to install: the Whisper models download themselves the first time you transcribe (into the app's data folder).

## The interface

```
┌────────────┬──────────────────────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Media /    │                              │  Inspector  │
│ Text       │        Preview               │  (of the    │

```

- **Media**: import with `+ Import` or by dragging files from Finder/Explorer; **double-click** a media item to add it to the timeline.
- **Text**: appears when there are transcripts; from there you edit the video by deleting or moving words.
- **Preview**: real frames from the engine (uses a lightweight proxy if the file is large). When paused, the frame is exact to the export.
- **Inspector**: all the properties of the selected clip; with nothing selected it shows the AI settings (Whisper model/language).

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Space` | Play / pause |
| `J` / `K` / `L` | Shuttle: back / pause / forward (repeat doubles: 1→2→4→8×) |
| `S` (or `⌘K`) | Split the clip under the playhead (linked clips split together) |
| `Del` / `Backspace` | Delete selection · with `⇧` it deletes **and closes the gap** (ripple) |
| `←` / `→` | One frame back/forward · with `⇧` ten frames |
| `Home` | Go to 0 |
| `I` / `O` | Mark in / out of the **work range** (amber band on the ruler) |
| `⇧X` | Clear the I–O range |
| `⌘Z` / `⌘⇧Z` | Undo / redo |
| `⌘S` / `⌘O` | Save / open project |
| `Alt` (while dragging) | Disables snapping |

---

## Timeline editing

- **Move**: drag a clip; the **magnet** snaps it to other clips' edges, the playhead, 0, the I–O range, and markers (a dotted guide appears when it snaps; `Alt` disables it).
- **Trim**: drag a clip's **edges** (handles visible when selected).
- **Multi-selection**: drag a **rectangle** over empty area (marquee); `⇧` adds to the selection. The status bar shows how many clips you have so far.
- **Linked clips 🔗**: adding a video with audio creates two clips (video on `V*`, audio on `A*`) that behave as one: split, move, trim, change speed, or delete affects both. `Inspector → Link → Unlink` separates them.
- **Tracks**: `+V` / `+A` add tracks; in the header: `M` mutes, `S` solos, 🔒 locks, **double-click the name** renames, ✕ deletes (undoable), and on audio tracks the **dB is dragged** vertically (double-click → 0 dB).
- **Real multi-layer**: the lowest video track is the base; clips on higher tracks are composited on top (with their position, scale, and opacity) in the export too.
- **Speed**: 0.25×–4× presets in the Inspector. In the export **the voice's pitch is preserved** (atempo); in live playback the pitch changes for now.

## Transform and keyframes

Every clip has **Position X/Y, Opacity, Scale, and Rotation** (and audio, **Gain**). Next to each slider:

- `◇` — the property doesn't animate; click = **create a keyframe** at the playhead (the property becomes animated).
- `◆` — there's a keyframe right at the playhead; click = remove it.
- With the property animated, **moving the slider writes a keyframe** at the playhead (like Premiere/Resolve) and the displayed value is the one at the playhead.
- Below it, the **curve editor** appears: drag the diamonds (time and value), **double-click** adds or removes keys, and when you select a key you choose its interpolation (**linear / step / smooth**).
- The diamonds are also drawn on the selected clip in the timeline.

The animation looks **the same when paused, playing, and in the export** (same curve math on all three paths). Crop exists but isn't animatable from the UI yet.

## Effects (modular packs)

`Inspector → Effects → + Add effect`. Included: **Chroma Key**, Color correction, Gaussian blur, and Vertical: blurred background. Each effect comes from a `manifest.json` (parameters + ffmpeg template), so preview and export use exactly the same chain.

**Your own packs**: create a folder at `«app config»/effects/<my-effect>/manifest.json` and press `↻ packs`. An invalid manifest breaks nothing (it's reported) and a pack with the same `id` as a core one replaces it.

## Generators (shapes and backgrounds)

**▦ Shape** button in the timeline → adds a generated clip:

- **Solid rectangle**: color, width, and height.
- **Gradient**: two colors (diagonal).

You change the type and parameters in `Inspector → Generator`. Since they're normal clips, the full transform applies to them: you can keyframe a panel that slides in, make it semi-transparent behind a title, etc. Same manifest system as the effects (`generators/` folder).

## Text, titles, and templates

- **+ Title** adds text at the playhead (on a free track).
- `Inspector → Text`: content, **system font** (all installed ones), size, color, left/center/right alignment, and position X/Y.
- **Templates**: save a named style and apply it to any title later.
- Everything is burned into the export with the same font and placement you see in the preview.

## Transitions

`Inspector → Transition` (on the clip to the right of the cut): **11 types** (crossfade, wipes, slides, circle, dissolve, pixelize, radial) with configurable duration. The handles extend to both sides, limited by the available material, and they also work between clips at different speeds.

---

## AI

### Transcription (Whisper)

- **T** button on a media item in the pool → transcribes word by word (the model downloads itself). `T✓` = already transcribed.
- **Model and language** are chosen in the Inspector with nothing selected (`AI · Whisper`): tiny/base/small/medium/large-v3-turbo, language auto/es/en/…

### Text-based editing

**Text** tab: the full transcript, with the current word highlighted during playback (click a word = seek).

- Mark words and **✂ Cut** — removes those pieces of the video **on all tracks** and closes the gaps (1 undo).
- **⇢ Move** — reorders a range of material to another point in the timeline (reorders spoken phrases without touching blades).

### Silences

`Inspector → Silences` (clip with audio):

- **🔇 Remove** — cuts the silences and closes the gaps (all tracks, 1 undo).
- **⏩ Speed up 4×** — instead of deleting, it speeds up the silent stretches.
- Sliders for **threshold (dB)**, **minimum duration**, and **margin** around speech.

### Automatic subtitles

**💬** button on a transcribed clip. Three modes in `Inspector → Subtitles`:

- **By phrases** — one line per segment.
- **Word by word** — one big word at a time (shorts style).
- **Karaoke** — the full phrase visible and **each word lights up as it's spoken** (configurable highlight color).

### Automatic vertical (Shorts/Reels)

**📱 Vertical** button → generates a 1080×1920 sequence with a blurred background and the video centered. The sequence selector (next to the timeline buttons) lets you switch back to the horizontal one. Each sequence exports separately.

### Reactive avatar

**🧑‍🎤** button on a transcribed clip → pick the avatar `config.json` (Youtubers-toolkit-compatible format: one looping video per emotion). The avatar appears in the corner, **changes emotion based on what you say** (offline energy/rhythm classifier, or OpenAI-compatible if you set `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and in the export it shakes to the beat of the volume. Visible when paused, playing, and in the export.

---

## Audio

- **Gain** (animatable with keyframes), **Pan** (balance law), in/out **fades** per clip.
- Per-**track** volume (drag the dB in the header).
- **RMS L/R meters** in the transport bar during playback.
- Audio is the **master clock**: the position comes from the frames served to the device (no drift).
- **Background noise removal** per clip (`Audio → Reduce background noise`): Facebook's DNS64
  neural denoiser, rendered in the background — playback and export switch to the exact same
  clean audio when ready. **Self-contained**: on first use the app provisions its own Python
  venv under its data dir (needs a system `python3`/`python` ≥ 3.9; ~200 MB one-time download).
  `UE_DENOISER_PYTHON` points to a custom interpreter (`off` disables); without any Python the
  app falls back to ffmpeg's `afftdn`.

## Export

**Export…** button:

- **Presets**: YouTube 1080p, YouTube 4K, Maximum quality, Quick draft, **Audio only (M4A)**, and **GIF**.
- Adjustable: maximum resolution, CRF quality, codec speed, audio bitrate.
- Optional **R128 normalization** (−14 LUFS, YouTube style).
- **Range I–O**: exports only the range marked with `I`/`O`.
- Live progress on the button and a **Cancel** that cleans up the half-written file.

## Projects

- **`.uep`** format (readable JSON), **portable**: media paths are stored relative to the project — move the whole folder to another disk/machine and open it.
- Media that can't be found stay **offline** (in red) with a **Relink…** button.
- **Autosave**: every minute (if there are changes) a `.uep.autosave` copy is written; if the app dies, on startup it offers to **recover**. A real save invalidates it.
- The caches (conformed audio, proxies, waveforms, thumbnails) live outside the project, indexed by content hash: they regenerate themselves on another machine.

## MCP server (agent-based editing)

On startup, the app brings up an MCP server at `http://127.0.0.1:4599/mcp` (loopback only) **protected with a token** (generated at startup; find it in the «MCP» pill in the header, which includes the connection command ready to copy):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http ubereditor http://127.0.0.1:4599/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

14 tools: `get_project_summary`, `get_timeline`, `get_media_pool`, `get_effects_catalog`, `get_transcript`, `add_clip`, `split_clip`, `delete_clips`, `set_clip_transition`, `remove_silences` (with mode and parameters), `move_range`, `generate_vertical`, `undo`, `redo`. Everything an agent does is undoable from the UI.

---

## Development

```bash
cargo test                    # the whole Rust suite (unit + pixel over real ffmpeg)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets

npm run dev                   # UI in the browser with the MOCK engine (http://localhost:5175)
npm run typecheck

npx tauri dev                 # the real app

npm run screenshot            # visual tests: 13 steps with functional assertions
                              #   → screenshots/<date>/*.png (starts vite only if needed)
```

### Architecture (crates)

| Crate | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ue-core` | Pure model, actions with mechanical inverses, transactional history, keyframe curves |
| `ue-media` | ffprobe, hashing, preview frames (MJPEG), proxies, thumbnails, audio conforming |
| `ue-audio` | mmap'd WAV, pure mixer (testable), cpal output (master clock), peaks |
| `ue-render` | Effect and generator packs (manifest → ffmpeg chain), transform and animation expressions |
| `ue-export` | EDL, ffmpeg graph (multi-layer, transitions, text/karaoke, avatar), progress and cancellation |
| `ue-ai` | Silence detection (hysteresis + padding), emotion classification |
| `ue-whisper` | whisper-rs (Metal/CUDA), per-word timestamps, model downloads |
| `src-tauri` | IPC commands, FrameService, MCP server, autosave |

Time convention: microseconds (`i64`) throughout the model; rational fps; ULID ids. The frontend mirrors the serde types by hand (`src/engine/types.ts`) and has two interchangeable engines: `TauriEngine` (real IPC) and `MockEngine` (browser demo).
